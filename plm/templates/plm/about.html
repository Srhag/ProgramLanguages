        Nowadays, there are numerous programming languages are becoming more general and all-purpose,
        but these languages have their specialties, and each language has its own advantages and disadvantages.
        Usually, programming languages can be classified into a few types, however,
        these languages support multiple programming style.
        Every year there are a number of programming languages are implemented,
        but few languages are becoming very popular which may used by a professional programmer in their career.
    </p>
    <p>
        Programming languages are used to control the performance of the computer or machine.
        At present, computer programmer has many choices to choose the language,
        but there are many differences between programming languages.
        So, this article gives a brief information regarding what are the different types of programming languages,
        differences between programming languages and types of programming languages in useful ways.

        <h2>What is Programming Language?</h2>
        <p>
            A programming language is a notation designed to connect instructions to a machine or a computer.
            Programming languages are mainly used to control the performance of a machine or to express
            algorithms. At present, thousand programming languages have been implemented.
            In the computer field, many languages need to be stated in an imperative form,
            while other programming languages utilize declarative form.
            The program can be divided into two forms such as syntax and semantics.
            Some languages are defined by an SO standard like C language.

        <h3>Types of Programming Languages</h3>
        <p>The different types of programming languages are discussed below.</p>
    </p>
        <h3>Types of Programming Paradigms</h3>
        <p>
            <h4>Functional Programming Language</h4>
            <p>
                Functional programming language typically uses stored data, frequently avoiding loops in favor of recursive
                functions.The functional programing’s primary focus is on the return values of functions, and side effects and different
                suggests that storing state are powerfully discouraged. For example, in an exceedingly pure useful language, if a
                function is termed, it’s expected that the function not modify or perform any o/p. It may, however, build algorithmic
                calls and alter the parameters of these calls. Functional languages are usually easier and build it easier to figure on
                abstract issues, however, they’ll even be “further from the machine” therein their programming model makes it difficult
                to know precisely, but the code is decoded into machine language (which are often problematic for system programming).
            </p>

            <h4>Object-oriented Programming Language</h4>
            <p>
                This programming language views the world as a group of objects that have internal data and external accessing parts of
                that data. The aim this programming language is to think about the fault by separating it into a collection of objects
                that offer services which can be used to solve a specific problem. One of the main principle of object oriented
                programming language is encapsulation that everything an object will need must be inside of the object. This language
                also emphasizes reusability through inheritance and the capacity to spread current implementations without having to
                change a great deal of code by using polymorphism.
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>Scripting Programming Language</h4>
            <p>
                These programming languages are often procedural and may comprise object-oriented language elements, but they fall into
                their own category as they are normally not full-fledged programming languages with support for development of large
                systems. For example, they may not have compile-time type checking. Usually, these languages require tiny syntax to get
                started.
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Logic Programming Language</h4>
            <p>
                These types of languages let programmers make declarative statements and then allow the machine to reason about the
                consequences of those statements. In a sense, this language doesn’t tell the computer how to do something, but employing
                restrictions on what it must consider doing.

                To call these groups ” types of language ” is really a bit confusing. It’s easy to program in an object-oriented style
                in C language. In truth, most of the languages include ideas and features from various domains, which only helps to
                increase the usefulness of these types of languages. Nevertheless, most of the programming languages do not best in all
                styles of programming.
